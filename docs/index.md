# Welcome to the PDI NOMAD Plugin Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the **PDI NOMAD Plugin**! This plugin provides NOMAD schemas, readers, and parsers for data of materials science synthesis processes in alignment with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles. It serves as a plugin for the Paul Drude Institute (PDI) and inherits from community or standard plugin:

- [nomad-material-processing](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-material-processing)

- [nomad-measurements](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-measurements)

## Supported Material Processing Techniques

Currently, this plugin supports the following material processing techniques:

- **Synthesis from Gas Phase**:
  Supports different *Vapor Deposition* methods:

  ```bash
  Vapor Deposition
  └── Phyiscal Vapor Deposition (PVD)
          └── Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE)

  ```

- **Synthesis from Solution**:
  Supports Solution Preparation

Stay tuned for updates as more methods become available!

## What You Will Find in This Documentation

This documentation builds upon the general [NOMAD documentation](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/staging/docs/explanation/data.html). Here, you will find comprehensive guides on:

- **Using the Plugin**: Step-by-step instructions on how to integrate and use the NOMAD Material Processing Plugin in your NOMAD Oasis.
- **Data Structures and Supported Methods**: Detailed descriptions of the available schemas, sections, and supported material processing techniques.
- **Contributing**: Learn how you can contribute to the ongoing development of this plugin.

## About NOMAD

NOMAD is an open-source data management platform tailored for materials science, designed to follow the FAIR principles. It offers a robust framework for managing and sharing materials data in a standardized and interoperable manner. To learn more about NOMAD, visit the [official homepage](https://nomad-lab.eu).


We hope this documentation provides all the information you need to make the most of the NOMAD Measurements Plugin. Feel free to [contact](contact.md) us for further questions.
